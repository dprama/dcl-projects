content1: ['Onette is an Indonesian personal care brand that delivers
                homemade products from essential oils to end products (soap,
                massage oil, etc.)', 'The company's objective is to educate its audience so they can
                switch to natural products for their daily needs because the
                chemicals in daily personal care (soap, shampoo, etc.) are
                dangerous in the long term.', 'The design is inspired by the "Natural" world in which these
                products are made. Every product has all natural and premium
                quality ingredients.']
