content1: ['Onette is an Indonesian personal care brand that delivers homemade products from essential oils to end products (soap, massage oil, etc.)', 'The company&apos;s objective is to educate its audience so they can switch to natural products for their daily needs because the chemicals in daily personal care (soap, shampoo, etc.) are dangerous in the long term.', 'The design is inspired by the &quot;Natural&quot; world in which these products are made. Every product has all natural and premium quality ingredients.']
content2: ['Transform Onette identity redesign into a modern and natural look with these two contrasted elements to create a visual balance that is easy to read and recognize.', 'Younger and more mature for modern young women.',
'In making the logomark, we&apos;ve been inspired by the leaves a commonly used natural symbol, and trying to put their initial letter with leaves.', 'Working with the owner, we aimed to achieve a visual identity that should be closer to their current brand, while showing a maturation and refinement that was reflective of their brand growth.',
'Hence, we looking for a serif that offered modern, mature, and premium looks, showing a new level in a typeface. Goldenbook was chosen for these reasons, while Filson Pro is a sans serif and offers a bit of warmth and approachability in its overall appearance. We felt that Filson Pro typeface is still perfect to be used as body text for its label design, in the way they work and can complete each other combined with Goldenbook as title text.']
content3: ['And for label design, their brief is to want it to look a bit premium, but not really premium/luxury, one that looks expensive but is friendly. They originally wanted a soft color that feels elegant, modern, and not so white.', 'Our problem is elegant with soft colors and different colors for each label product. We have an option for this, offering a design with one color & pattern or one color & silhouette/graphic vector.', 'As for the results, we use a lighter line background for modern and friendly looks. The label consists of 3 sections, there are 2 sections with thin line patterns and a blocky colored section.']
