content1: ['Onette is an Indonesian personal care brand that delivers
                homemade products from essential oils to end products (soap,
                massage oil, etc.)', 'The company&apos;s objective is to educate its audience so they can
                switch to natural products for their daily needs because the
                chemicals in daily personal care (soap, shampoo, etc.) are
                dangerous in the long term.', 'The design is inspired by the &quot;Natural&quot; world in which these
                products are made. Every product has all natural and premium
                quality ingredients.']
content2: ['And for label design, their brief is to want it to look a bit
                premium, but not really premium/luxury, one that looks expensive
                but is friendly. They originally wanted a soft color that feels
                elegant, modern, and not so white.', 'Our problem is elegant with soft colors and different colors for
                each label product. We have an option for this, offering a
                design with one color & pattern or one color &
                silhouette/graphic vector.', 'As for the results, we use a lighter line background for modern
                and friendly looks. The label consists of 3 sections, there are
                2 sections with thin line patterns and a blocky colored section.']
