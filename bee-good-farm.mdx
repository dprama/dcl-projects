They have all coverage of customers and all walks of life - honey is pure and raw, which can make a difference from other competitors.', 'We help to establish their brand for visual identity, to get known in the local market reputation.']

The logo style is a little bit masculine and complex, just a typical honey brand look.', 'The logo uses a honeycomb frame with a bee inside and to add a little complexity, there is a curved line around the bee - to emphasize where bees belong in highland surrounded by nature.',
Whereas for wordmark we use a quality of boldness Brothers OT to add some masculine and also good as a display font for later labels we will create.']
